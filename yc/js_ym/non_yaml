West Virginia will use the U.S. Postal Service and an online account this summer to connect with Medicaid enrollees about the expected end of the COVID-19 public health emergency, which will put many recipients at risk of losing their coverage.

What West Virginia won't do is use a form of communication that's ubiquitous worldwide: text messaging.

"West Virginia isn't set up to text its members," Allison Adler, the state's Medicaid spokesperson, wrote to KHN in an email.

Indeed, most states' Medicaid programs won't text enrollees despite the urgency to reach them about renewing their coverage. A Kaiser Family Foundation report published in March found just 11 states said they would use texting to alert Medicaid recipients about the end of the COVID public health emergency. In contrast, 33 states plan to use snail mail and at least 20 will reach out with individual or automated phone calls.
